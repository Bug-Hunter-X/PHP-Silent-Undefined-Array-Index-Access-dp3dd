# PHP Silent Undefined Array Index Access

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in PHP: the silent handling of undefined array indices. When accessing an array index that doesn't exist, PHP doesn't throw an error; instead, it returns null. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues, especially in more complex applications.

The `bug.php` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.php` illustrates how to safely access array values using `isset()` to prevent unexpected null values.
